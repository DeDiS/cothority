Making Contributions

Cothority is an Open Source program with many contributors (listed in the AUTHORS
files), so we actively seek contributions (help on the Cothority users list,
documentation, source code, ideas, …).  All contributions help us make a
better product.

All contributions without an explicit copyright statement or a CAA (see below)
are assumed to be covered under a BSD 2-Clause license.

Developers who have contributed significant changes to the Cothority code must sign
a Copyright Assignment Agreement (CAA — formerly called a Fiduciary License
Agreement or FLA), which guarantees them the right to use the code they have
developed, and also ensures that EPFL/DEDIS (and thus the Cothority project) has the
rights to the code.  By signing the CAA, your contributions are eligible to
be integrated into the Cothority source code.  Having the CAA signed is essential
for the Cothority project to maintain a clean copyright and guarantees that Cothority
and your source code will always remain Free Software (Open Source).  Providing
that your contribution is accepted by the Cothority project, your signed CAA also
permits EPFL/DEDIS to submit your contribution for  use in the Cothority Enterprise
Edition. The Copyright Assignment Agreement is found on the EPFL/DEDIS web site at:
