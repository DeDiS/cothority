/*
Cothority-SDA is a framework that allows testing, simulating and
deploying crypto-related protocols.

# Running a simulation

Your best starting point is the simul/-directory where you can start different
protocols and test them on your local computer. After building, you can
start any protocol you like:
	cd simul
	go build
	./simul runfiles/test_cosi.toml
Once a simulation is done, you can look at the results in the test_data-directory:
	cat test_data/test_cosi.csv
To have a simple plot of the round-time, you need to have matplotlib installed
in version 1.5.1.
	matplotlib/plot.py test_data/test_cosi.csv
If plot.py complains about missing matplotlib-library, you can install it using
	sudo easy_install "matplotlib == 1.5.1"
at least on a Mac.

# Writing your own protocol

If you want to experiment with a protocol of your own, have a look at
the protocols-package-documentation.

# Deploying

Unfortunately it's not possible to deploy the Cothority as a stand-alon app.
Well, it is possible, but there is no way to start a protocol.
